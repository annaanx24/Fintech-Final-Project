# FinKids - A Financial Literacy Educational Platform for Kids
by Althea Bata, Kamille Tipan, and Anna Xia as the final project for FinTech Focus 2020

## Features
- Tabs for information with short phrases and visuals, game page, login, and homepage
- Piggy bank game with prize system developed using JavaScript
- Gated pages for signup and login
- Animated CSS for signup and login 
- Responsive web design and bootstrap
- Chatbot with random fact generator 

## Why
There are so many ways kids are exposed to finance: birthday money, allowances, bakesales, lemonade stands, grocery shopping, small jobs, and more. There are no national financial literacy classes either, and often most students learn about finance on their own, but still not completely. It's important to understand financial concepts like banking, investing, and what money is and can be used for.
